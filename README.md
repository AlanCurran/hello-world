# hello-world
First repository to learn Github
I'm AllAboutAlan, and I'm starting my journey with coding. I have zero experience in coding, but I'm keen to learn all I can. I'm thinking about starting with Python, and I have recently bought a Rasperry Pi 3 and Rasperry Pi Zero W so I can experiment with physical computing in relation to coding. 

Exciting times ahead!
